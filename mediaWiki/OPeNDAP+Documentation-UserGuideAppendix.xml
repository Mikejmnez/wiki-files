The current version of the Distributed Oceanographic Data System core
software is \OPDversion .  Note that this number applies only to the
core software.  The individual servers, clients, and client libraries
have their own version numbers.

Full information about the latest versions of the OPeNDAP software is
available from the OPeNDAP web site: \OPDhome .

This version of OPeNDAP uses CGI standard 1.1.1.

==Acquiring the OPeNDAP Software== 



====The OPeNDAP Web Site====

We recommend that you use the \OPDhome to obtain the most current
version of the software.  The "Software" page includes a form for
selecting OPeNDAP components.  Completing the form automatically creates
a custom compressed archive of all the software components you
selected, which you can then download to your own machine.

Whenever possible, you should use the provided binary software rather
than t
rying to compile and link OPeNDAP yourself.  Compiling will work,
but the OPeNDAP software is large, and it takes a long time to compile.

Don't forget to select the core software as well as the specific data
access API or server you need.  For an OPeNDAP client, you will also need
&lt;font color='green'&gt;Tcl/Tk&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color='green'&gt;gzip&lt;/font&gt;.


====By Anonymous FTP====

The OPeNDAP software may be down-loaded by anonymous &lt;font color='green'&gt;ftp&lt;/font&gt; from
the \OPDftp .

Don't forget to down-load the core software &lt;font color='green'&gt;tar&lt;/font&gt; file as well as
the &lt;font color='green'&gt;tar&lt;/font&gt; file corresponding to whatever data access API you need.

The OPeNDAP project provides a small number of archive files containing
linked libraries and executables for some computing platforms.  You
should use these files whenever possible, to avoid the hassle of
compiling the software yourself.  The OPeNDAP software is a substantial
chunk of code, and it takes a long time to compile and link.

==Installing the Software==


To install the OPeNDAP software, choose a directory to be the OPeNDAP root
directory.  This directory must be identified with the
&lt;font color='green'&gt;DODS_ROOT&lt;/font&gt; environment variable for the OPeNDAP software to
run.

First, set the working directory to the &lt;font color='green'&gt;DODS_ROOT&lt;/font&gt; directory.For
example,

&lt;pre&gt;
export DODS_ROOT=/usr/local/DODS
cd $DODS_ROOT
&lt;/pre&gt;


Next, expand the archives with &lt;font color='green'&gt;gzip&lt;/font&gt; and unpack the expanded
files with &lt;font color='green'&gt;tar&lt;/font&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;
gzip -d DODS-88772.tar.gz
tar -xvf DODS-88772.tar
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you got the files via anonymous ftp, you would have to repeat the
process for each down-loaded archive file, specifying the name of each
component file.  For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
gzip -d DODS-core-2.19.tar.gz
tar -xvf DODS-core-2.19.tar
&lt;/pre&gt;

====Building the OPeNDAP Core====

Unpacking the core software archive will create a configure script in
the &lt;font color='green'&gt;DODS_ROOT&lt;/font&gt; directory.  The core software may then be built
with:

&lt;pre&gt;
cd $DODS_ROOT
./configure
make
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you downloaded binary files, you can skip the "building" steps.

====Building an OPeNDAP Client or Server====

Unpacking the client library archives in the &lt;font color='green'&gt;DODS_ROOT&lt;/font&gt;
directory will produce directories such as &lt;font color='green'&gt;jg-dods&lt;/font&gt; for the JGOFS
software and &lt;font color='green'&gt;nc-dods&lt;/font&gt; for the netCDF software.  These will appear
in the &lt;font color='green'&gt;src&lt;/font&gt; subdirectory under &lt;font color='green'&gt;DODS_ROOT&lt;/font&gt;.  Each of these
directories will also be equipped with a configure script to create a
makefile, so the build procedure for them is the same as for the core
software, for example:

&lt;pre&gt;
cd $DODS_ROOT/src/nc-dods
./configure
make
&lt;/pre&gt;


====Getting the Software Used by DODS====

Several pieces of software are required to run OPeNDAP.  These are all
free software, and are descibed in \appref{req-software}.

===Installing the OPeNDAP Libraries===


In order to link and run client programs, the only OPeNDAP software that
must be installed are the OPeNDAP libraries. The following libraries,
described in ([http://www &lt;cite&gt; opd-client,link&lt;/cite&gt;]) must be installed in the
&lt;font color='green'&gt;/usr/lib&lt;/font&gt; directory, or somewhere else where the linker will find
them. Simply copy them into that directory from the OPeNDAP distribution.


*&lt;font color='green'&gt;libdap++.a&lt;/font&gt;
*The OPeNDAP version of the API your software uses.

In addition to the OPeNDAP libraries, the following software is also
required to link an OPeNDAP client.  You can obtain them from the
\OPDhome or \OPDftp .  (Look under your machine
type, then under &lt;font color='green'&gt;DODS/packages/lib&lt;/font&gt;.)  The first two libraries
should be part of the Tcl/Tk distribution.  The other three libraries
are GNU software.

*&lt;font color='green'&gt;libtcl.a&lt;/font&gt;
*&lt;font color='green'&gt;libexpect.a&lt;/font&gt;
*&lt;font color='green'&gt;libstdc++.a&lt;/font&gt;
*&lt;font color='green'&gt;librx.a&lt;/font&gt; (Regular expression software.  Part of the
&lt;font color='green'&gt;regex&lt;/font&gt; package.)
*&lt;font color='green'&gt;libz.a&lt;/font&gt; (Compression software.  Part of the &lt;font color='green'&gt;gzip&lt;/font&gt;
distribution.)

To run an OPeNDAP client, you should have the &lt;font color='green'&gt;wish&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color='green'&gt;gzip&lt;/font&gt;
programs in the &lt;font color='green'&gt;PATH&lt;/font&gt;, and the following Tcl programs must be
either in the &lt;font color='green'&gt;DODS_ROOT/etc&lt;/font&gt; directory:


*&lt;font color='green'&gt;dod_gui.tcl&lt;/font&gt;
*&lt;font color='green'&gt;progress.tcl&lt;/font&gt;
*&lt;font color='green'&gt;error.tcl&lt;/font&gt;

An OPeNDAP client will still execute without these programs, but important
functionality, including the GUI manager and the data compression will
be absent.  Refer to the &lt;font color='green'&gt;INSTALL&lt;/font&gt; file included in each
distribution for specific information about setting up the client.


==The OPeNDAP Client Initialization File (&lt;font color='green'&gt;.dodsrc&lt;/font&gt;)==

The following section refers only to OPeNDAP clients from release 3.2 and
after.



When an OPeNDAP client starts up, it checks to
see whether the user has an initialization file available to control
the setting of a number of parameters having to do with caching, proxy
servers, and other http issues.  If this file is not found, one is
created in the user's home directory, using default
values.\footnote{The default values enable a maximum cache size of 20

megabytes, a cache expiration time of 24 hours, and no proxy servers.}

The client initialization file is usually called &lt;font color='green'&gt;.dodsrc&lt;/font&gt;, and is
usually located in the user's home directory.  You can change this by
creating an environment variable called &lt;font color='green'&gt;DODS_CACHE_INIT&lt;/font&gt; and
setting it to the full pathname of the configuration file.  As of OPeNDAP
version 3.4, you should use &lt;font color='green'&gt;DODS_CONF&lt;/font&gt; instead.
&lt;font color='green'&gt;DODS_CACHE_INIT&lt;/font&gt; is deprecated, and will disappear in future
releases.

Here is a sample configuration file:

\begin{vcode}{inb}
# Sample configuration file
USE_CACHE=1
MAX_CACHE_SIZE=20
MAX_CACHED_OBJ=5
IGNORE_EXPIRES=0
CACHE_ROOT=/home/user/.dods_cache/
DEFAULT_EXPIRES=86400
PROXY_SERVER=http,http://dcz.dods.org/
PROXY_FOR=http://dax.dods.org/.*,http://dods.org/
NO_PROXY_FOR=http://dcz.dods.org
DEFLATE=1
ALWAYS_VALIDATE=0
&lt;/pre&gt;

====Comments====

Starting a line with a &lt;font color='green'&gt;\#&lt;/font&gt; makes that line a comment.

====Caching====


The parameters on lines 2 through 7 control caching.  The OPeNDAP client
can store data you've requested on your local computer.  If you repeat
a request, the data can be retrieved from this local cache, saving the
expense of a network connection.  Most web browsers operate the same
way.  You can control the caching behavior with the following
configuration file parameters.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
; &lt;font color='green'&gt;CACHE_ROOT&lt;/font&gt; : This parameter contains the pathname to the
cache's top directory.  If two or more users want to share a cache,
then they must both have read and write permissions to the cache
root.

; &lt;font color='green'&gt;MAX_CACHE_SIZE&lt;/font&gt; : The value of &lt;font color='green'&gt;MAX_CACHE_SIZE&lt;/font&gt; sets the maximum size of the cache in megabytes.  Once the cache reaches
this size, caching more objects will cause cache garbage collection.
OPeNDAP will first purge the cache of any stale entries and then remove
remaining entries starting with those that have the lowest hit
count. Garbage collection stops when 90\
purged.

; &lt;font color='green'&gt;MAX_CACHED_OBJ&lt;/font&gt; : This parameter sets the maximum size of
any individual object in the cache in megabytes. Objects received
from a server larger than this value will not be cached even if
there's room for them without purging other objects.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Many web documents, and OPeNDAP data, are delivered with an expiration
date in their header information.  Generally, this is done for
time-sensitive information that may not be valid after the expiration
date.  You can control the behavior of the OPeNDAP client with respect to
expiration dates with two configuration file parameters.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
; &lt;font color='green'&gt;IGNORE_EXPIRES&lt;/font&gt; : If the value of this parameter is 1
(one), then expiration dates will be ignored, and the caching
behavior will be ruled by the &lt;font color='green'&gt;DEFAULT_EXPIRES&lt;/font&gt; parameter.

; &lt;font color='green'&gt;DEFAULT_EXPIRES&lt;/font&gt; : Any data received without an expiration
time will expire in the number of seconds given by this parameter.
If &lt;font color='green'&gt;IGNORE_EXPIRES&lt;/font&gt; is zero, this will apply to all data,
whether or not it comes with an expiration date.  The value is given
in seconds.  The configuration in the example is set for 24 hours.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Proxy Servers====


An OPeNDAP client can negotiate proxy servers, with help from directions
derived from its configuration file.  There are three parameters that
control proxy behavior.  There can be more than one of each of these
declarations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
; &lt;font color='green'&gt;PROXY_SERVER&lt;/font&gt; : This identifies a proxy server to use for
all OPeNDAP requests, except for requests specifically modified by the
other two proxy behavior directives.  The format is:

&lt;pre&gt;
PROXY_SERVER=\var{protocol},\var{proxy_URL}

&lt;/pre&gt;

Where \var{protocol} is the name of an internet protocol, and
\var{proxy_URL} must be a full URL to the host running the proxy
server.  HTTP is the only internet protocol supported by DODS, so
\var{protocol} will always read &lt;font color='green'&gt;http&lt;/font&gt;.  There can be more than
one proxy declaration, in which case, the OPeNDAP client will use the
first proxy server on the list that responds.

; &lt;font color='green'&gt;PROXY_FOR&lt;/font&gt; : The &lt;font color='green'&gt;PROXY_FOR&lt;/font&gt; parameter provides a way to specify that URLs which match a regular expression should be
accessed using a particular proxy server. The syntax for PROXY_FOR
is:

&lt;pre&gt;
PROXY_FOR=\var{regular expression},\var{proxy_URL}[,\var{flags}]

&lt;/pre&gt;

Where \var{regular expression} is an expression which matches the
URL or group of URLs. For example `http://dax.dods.org/.*\.hdf'
would match a URL ending in `.hdf' at dax.dods.org. The regular
expression uses the POSIX basic syntax.\var{proxy_URL} is the
same as above.

The \var{flags} parameter is an optional integer that configures the
regular expression matcher. A value of zero sets the default. The
four flag values and their meanings are:


&lt;blockquote&gt;

; &lt;font color='green'&gt;REG_EXTENDED&lt;/font&gt; : If set, use the POSIX extended syntax
regular expressions.  To set this, add 1 to the value of \var{flags}.

; &lt;font color='green'&gt;REG_NEWLINE&lt;/font&gt;] If set, then &lt;font color='green'&gt;.&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color='green'&gt;[\^{ &lt;/font&gt;... :}
don't match newline.  Also, the regular expression matcher will
try a match beginning after every newline. Set this by adding 2 to
\var{flags}.

; &lt;font color='green'&gt;REG_ICASE&lt;/font&gt; : If set, then we consider upper- and
lowercase versions of letters to be equivalent when matching. Set
by adding 4 to \var{flags}.

; &lt;font color='green'&gt;REG_NOSUB&lt;/font&gt; : If set, then when &lt;font color='green'&gt;PREG&lt;/font&gt; is passed to regexec, that routine will report only success or failure, and nothing about the
registers. Add 8 to \var{flags} to set this.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You can find a brief tutorial to regular expressions in the OPeNDAP
bookshelf\texorhtml{. See the OPeNDAP documentation page at
\OPDhome}{at \OPDregex}.

; &lt;font color='green'&gt;NO_PROXY&lt;/font&gt; : Use this parameter to say that access to a
certain host should never go through a proxy without using the more
complicated regular expression syntax. The syntax of &lt;font color='green'&gt;NO_PROXY&lt;/font&gt;
is:

&lt;pre&gt;
NO_PROXY=\var{protocol},\var{hostname}

&lt;/pre&gt;


Where \var{protocol} is as for &lt;font color='green'&gt;PROXY_SERVER&lt;/font&gt;, \var{hostname}
is the name of the host, not a url.

====Compression====

Many OPeNDAP servers support compression of the returned data.  This can
save network bandwidth, and transmission time.  You can tell your
client to ask the server for compressed data by including a line in
your &lt;font color='green'&gt;.dodsrc&lt;/font&gt; file like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
DEFLATE=1
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using a value of zero will make the client request only uncompressed
data.  If the directive is omitted, the default value is zero.

====Validation====

Caching data locally can be risky if the data in question change
often.  The &lt;font color='green'&gt;ALWAYS_VALIDATE&lt;/font&gt; option controls whether the OPeNDAP
client checks the validity of the cached data.  The validity check in
this case is simply a comparison of the date the data was cached with
the "Last-modified" date of the remote data.  If the configuration
value is set to 1, the client will always validate the cached data.
If set to 0, the data will not be validated (but may expire, according
to the cache policy set by the &lt;font color='green'&gt;DEFAULT_EXPIRES&lt;/font&gt; configuration
directive).

If the directive is omitted, the default value is zero.  That is, the
default behavior is not to validate the data.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=Software you will need for OPeNDAP=



To do anything with DODS, you'll need to be able to unpack the archive
files you can download from the OPeNDAP site.  To save space and
transmission time, the archive files are compressed with the
&lt;font color='green'&gt;gzip&lt;/font&gt; program.  You will have to have a copy of that program to
unpack the OPeNDAP software.

Most of the software you need for OPeNDAP is avaliable from the GNU
archives.  Refer to \xlink{http://www.gnu.org}{http://www.gnu.org} forinstructions.  Look at
\xlink{http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html}{http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html}for a list of mirrors of that archive.  Use the mirror closest
to you, the transmission will be faster.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
; gzip : This is the GNU compression and de-compression program.

You will need to install it before you can unpack any of the other

software described here.  This package is ''not''

available in the OPeNDAP distribution, since it is used to unpack the

distribution archive files.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Follow the instructions to install each of the following software
packages.  Typically, you would install a package called &lt;font color='green'&gt;foo&lt;/font&gt; as
follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
gzip -dc foo.tar.gz | tar xvf -
cd foo
./configure
make
make install
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is simply a guide, of course, and the installation instructions
for each software package should be followed carefully.


==Running an OPeNDAP Server==

If you use one of the platforms for which OPeNDAP supplies a binary
distribution, you only need the following software to run an OPeNDAP
server.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
; Perl : Perl is used for the server dispatch script.  (See

([http://www &lt;cite&gt; opd-server,arch&lt;/cite&gt;]).) This is the main CGI program

constituting the OPeNDAP server.  You must have Perl version 5 or

later.  (Alternatively, you can also rewrite the dispatch script to

use another scripting language, such as your shell.  However, we

think installing Perl is generally a simpler task.)  You can get

Perl from the GNU archives, or from

\xlink{http://www.perl.com}{http://www.perl.com}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Running an OPeNDAP Client==

If you use one of the pre-compiled, out-of-the-box, OPeNDAP clients, you
will need no additional software to run OPeNDAP.  However, you can use
the "GUI" feature of the OPeNDAP client\footnote{This is not to be
confused with the OPeNDAP Matlab or IDL GUIs, which are clients of
their own.  This is simply a client feature that can display
transmission and error information to the user.} by installing the
following software.  We recommend this, as it provides useful
information about the progress of data transmission or error conditions.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
; Tcl/Tk : The Tcl language and Tk libraries are available from
\xlink{http://www.scriptics.com}{http://www.scriptics.com}. You  should install the entire package, including the &lt;font color='green'&gt;wish&lt;/font&gt;
interpreter program\footnote{You can also use a safe Tcl
interpreter.  Refer to the Tcl documentation for information.} and
the &lt;font color='green'&gt;expect&lt;/font&gt; package.  The &lt;font color='green'&gt;wish&lt;/font&gt; interpreter is
part of the Tcl/Tk core distribution package.  This package is also
available in the OPeNDAP distribution, but the one available from the
Tcl site may be more current.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Building OPeNDAP==

If you need to build the OPeNDAP software, or link it to existing
libraries, you will need the following GNU software.
Refer to \xlink{http://www.gnu.org}{http://www.gnu.org} forinstructions.  Look at
\xlink{http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html}{http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html}for a list of mirrors of that archive.  Use the mirror closest
to you, the transmission will be faster.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
; GNU \Cpp Compiler : OPeNDAP needs &lt;font color='green'&gt;g++&lt;/font&gt;, the GNU \Cpp compiler

to compile.
; binutils : The GNU linker is part of this package.
; libstdc++ : The standard \Cpp library.
; GNU Make : GNU Make is not essential, but will make like easier.
; flex : The GNU lexical-analyzer generator
; bison : The GNU parser generator.

== Description ==
WCS GetCoverage request, BES must compute response.

== Goal ==
The goal of this use case is to provide an end-to-end request/response to a GetCoverage request. It is intended to get the OLFS and BES involved in the WCS system, with the BES providing the response to this request.

== Summary == 

The primary actor, a person sitting at a computer, enters a pre-defined URL into their browser for a GetCoverage request and receives a link to a target NetCDF-CF response to be saved to their local disk.

We are attempting to coordinate communication between the OLFS and the BES in this WCS system, with a request coming in to the OLFS from the users browser, the OLFS formulating the request to the BES, and the BES responding to that request with the link to the target NetCDF-CF file.

The request and the response will be pre-defined. In other words, the user won’t be browsing around the catalogues or making GetCapabilities or DescribeCoverage calls. The BES will have '''not''' have a pre-built response.

== Actors ==
# Primary actor – user sitting at browser
# Secondary actor – OLFS – receives the request from the browser
# Secondary actor – BES – receives request from the OLFS and responds to the request
# Secondary actor – pre-built target NetCDF-CF file

== Preconditions ==
# Using the WCS 1.1.2 specification
# The request URL is a known request, provided for this use case
# The request parameters are in KVP format
# The request parameters version, request type and Id are already known
# The domain subset is in WGS84 BB, Circumscribe N.J. on grid vertices
# The temporal subset is optional and will be left out
# The range subset is optional and will be left out
# The target response file format will be NetCDF-CF
# The response from Hyrax will be a Hyrax link to the target file, not the file itself


== Triggers ==

The user enters the provided URL representing the GetCoverage request into the browser

== Basic Flow ==
# OLFS receives the request
# OLFS parses the KVP parameters from the request URL including:
#* WCS version, 
#* Request Type
#* Coverage ID
#* The domain subset (A WGS84 BoundingBox)
#* The temporal subset is not used
#* The range subset is not used
#* The format of the response.
# OLFS sends the request to the BES as an XML document
# The BES parses the XML document representing the GetCoverage request
# The BES matches the coverage id (and other input)
# The BES Constructs the binary response (a NetCDF-CF file) and caches it in a OLFS accessible location.
# The BES constructs an XML &lt;Coverages&gt; response
#* See WCS 1.1.2 Implementation Standard (OGC Document ''07-067r5'')  section 10.3.11
#* See OWS  (?) section 13.3 ('''MORE REFERENCES NEEDED HERE''')
#* Generate a NetCDF-CF binary response and cache it (if required).
# The BES returns the the coverage response to the OLFS.
# The OLFS returns the coverage response document to the user
# The user receives the response, containing the Hyrax URL to the target response file. The user takes that URL and enters it into their browser.
# The OLFS sends the request to the BES to stream the target response file back to the user. This functionality already exists (get stream for definition).

== Alternate Flow(s) ==

=== Error Flow (OLFS) ===
# OLFS receives the request
# OLFS attempts to parse the KVP parameters from the request.
# The parsing encounters a bad request (based on the 1.1.2 specification), or …
# The OLFS fails to connect to, or the connection drops to, the BES in Basic Flow step 6, or …
# The OLFS fails to connect to, or the connection drops to, the BES in Basic Flow step 12 …
# OLFS builds a WcsException and returns it to the user.

=== Error Flow (BES) ===
# See Basic Flow steps 1-3
# The BES fails to match the coverage id or some other input (Unsupported operations, CRS mismatch, etc.), or …
# The BES fails to access underlying data system that holds the data making up the coverage.
# In Basic Flow step 6, the BES fails to access the underlying data system that holds the data making up the coverage.
# The BES builds a WcsException element and returns it to the user via the OLFS.

== Post Conditions ==
None.

== Notes ==

'''Question:''' 
: Will the BES be streaming the response file back to the OLFS, and then on to the user? Or will the BES return a URL to the response file that the user will then click on to download?
:'''Answer:''' The BES will return a link to the target file, not stream the file back. The user will then be able to click on this link and save it to their local disk.

Bare-bones list of ideas:

1.  RSS feed for broadcasting changes in files/datasets served by Hyrax
2.  a per-directory config file for various handler parameters (like
    those that control how the HDF5 handler treats files)
3.  checksum for data returns
4.  a clone of Matlab's 'find' function
5.  plotting for the HTML form interface

Community forums for deciding on standards/processes within (and beyond)
the OPeNDAP community

Process developed at the February 2007 OPeNDAP Developer Meeting, in
Boulder CO.

The OPeNDAP community process draws on experience from other community
processes: e.g. IETF, OGC, ISO, JCP, Unidata.

## Working Group Attributes

To meet the needs of the OPeNDAP community, the following attributes of
the process had broad agreement:

1.  OPeNDAP working groups (OWG) should be formed with a specific focus,
    deliverables, timeframe and minimum membership. OPeNDAP would
    welcome agency, project or institutional sponsorship and/or
    co-sponsorship.
    1.  Specific focus - The working groups must define the areas of
        their work efforts as covering a) OPeNDAP the software, b)
        OPeNDAP (DAP) the specification, or c) both. Working Groups
        should only be formed for well-defined topics where the
        community feels the development of a deliverable is a high
        priority.
    2.  Deliverables/outcomes - Deliverables produced by a OWG fall into
        two categories. First, an OWG may produce software, either
        prototype or production. Second, an OWG may produce
        documentation including: Software specifications; Standard
        Operating Procedure documents; Best Practices documents; and
        Technical Notes. In some cases the OWG may reccommend that the
        ideas developed be taken to a more formal standards organization
        to be developed further.
    3.  Timeframe - OWGs should aim to complete their discussions, white
        papers, documents/proposals within a nominal 3 month timeframe.
        In cases where prototypes/software are to be produced the
        timeframe can be extended with OWG executive (see next item)
        approval), especially where funding is sought to complete the
        project. The intent is not to have stagnant or dormant efforts.
    4.  Minimum membership is 3 people.
2.  The OWG executive is nominated by the community and appointed by the
    OPeNDAP advisory board, with membership of 5-7 people, a nominal
    term limit for membership is 2 years. Members may serve more than
    one term (with board approval). The first task of the executive is
    to formalize the OWG Terms of Reference.
3.  The OWG executive will make recommendations on how to take OWG
    outcomes to standards processes and other relevant organizations for
    broader community comment, adoption, etc.
4.  The OPeNDAP advisory board membership will be broadened (serves
    OPeNDAP Inc.) to accommodate this expanded role and term limits will
    be applied to the board.
5.  OWGs can be proposed by anyone but must be chartered within the
    OPeNDAP community by the OWG executive.
6.  OWG forums should be public (via opendap.org supported wiki) EXCEPT
    for any OWG which addresses security of data service systems
    (discussion on if we can/should use US-CERT as an announcement forum
    for security matters is an item to be pursued).
7.  The only requirement for participation and comment on OWG forums is
    to be a registered user on the opendap.org provided wiki.
8.  The approval and decision making process may vary depending on the
    scope of the subject area. The OWG proposers must identify a
    suitable decision making process (if it is required) and the OWG
    executive must approve that process before the OWG can be chartered.
    In some cases, standards and specifications must have broad
    community comment and consensus before being adopted.

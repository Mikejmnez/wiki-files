## Formulation of Working Groups

The process for establishing and running a working group was developed
at the [2007 Developer's
Workshop](Report_on_the_2007_OPeNDAP_Developer%27s_Workshop "wikilink").
The essence of the process is that a small group is formed to work on a
problem and agrees to reach a conclusion within a short time frame. See
[Formulation of Working
Groups](Formulation_of_Working_Groups "wikilink") for more information
about the process.

## The Working Group Executive

Working groups can be proposed by anyone but must be chartered within
the OPeNDAP community by the executive. The Working Group Executive is
nominated by the community and appointed by the OPeNDAP advisory board.
There is a nominal term limit for membership is 2 years. Members may
serve more than one term (with advisory board approval). The executive
makes recommendations on how to take working group outcomes to standards
processes and other relevant organizations for broader community
comment, adoption, etc.

The current Working Group Executive members are:

- James Gallagher (OPeNDAP, [jgallagher at opendap dot
  org](mailto:jgallagher@opendap.org))
- Steve Hankin (NOAA, [Steven.C.Hankin at noaa dot
  gov](mailto:Steven.C.Hankin@noaa.gov))
- Denis Nadeau (NASA, [dnadeau at pop600 dot gsfc dot nasa
  dotgov](mailto:dnadeau@pop600.gsfc.nasa.gov))
- Tim Pugh (Bureau of Meteorology, Australia, [T.Pugh at bom dot gov dot
  au](mailto:T.Pugh@bom.gov.au))
- Russ Rew (Unidata, UCAR, [russ at unidata dot ucar dot
  edu](mailto:russ@unidata.ucar.edu))

The executive can be reached collectively at [owg-executive at opendap
dot org](mailto:owg-executive@opendap.org).

The OPeNDAP Working Group [Terms of
Reference](Terms_of_Reference "wikilink") Describe how the Executive
will make decisions about the working groups.

## Motivation

It has become apparent over the last few months that the installation,
configuration, and administration of Hyrax, both OLFS and BES, leaves
much to be desired. It can be somewhat complicated without clear, easy
to follow instructions. What can we do to fix this?

## Statement of Work

The work here can be broken down into two separate tasks, one short term
and one longer term.

1.  What can we do now to help people with installation, configuration,
    and administration
2.  What are our long-term goals to make Hyrax easier to install,
    configure, and administer. Installation Interface (through browser,
    java, ???). Configuration interface (perhaps the same as
    Installation Interface). Administrative interface with
    administrative API for OLFS and BES.

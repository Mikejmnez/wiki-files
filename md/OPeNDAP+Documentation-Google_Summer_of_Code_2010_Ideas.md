# OPeNDAP Google Summer of Code 2010

![](GSoC_2010_300x267px.jpg "GSoC_2010_300x267px.jpg") OPeNDAP would
like to welcome all the SoC students for the 2010 iteration of the SoC
program! On this page you'll find information about project ideas we
have along with information to help you apply to work on our software.
The projects range from web site implementation to complex problems in
data systems. Several of the projects listed are focused on adding new
features to our data server. However, we also have a set of client tools
and GUI-based applications that would provide an ample basis for summer
projects. If you don't see anything below in the
[\#Ideas](#Ideas "wikilink") section don't let that stop you from
starting a conversation with one of the mentors listed below
([\#Mentors](#Mentors "wikilink")) because you may have an idea, talent
or skill that is the spark of a great project. Don't hesitate to email
us!

We would like to stress that while the ideas included here can be the
basis of your project, you can also propose something completely
different - maybe you've used our software and wish it included a
particular feature.

Before submitting an application to GSoC with OPeNDAP as your mentoring
organization, make sure you read our [GSoC
FAQ](Google_Summer_of_Code_FAQ "wikilink"), which provides some pointers
on how to write a successful application.

Once you are ready to submit an application, remember that you must do
so **before April 9th** through the [GSoC
webapp](http://socghop.appspot.com/). A more complete
[timeline](http://socghop.appspot.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2010/timeline)
is available for the whole project period.

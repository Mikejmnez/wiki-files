The ODC plotter has a flexible text editing and placement system that
allows you to quickly and accurately locate text with little or no
guesswork.

<b>Key Points</b>

- To edit existing text, select desired text item in the "Text
  Annotations" box
- To add new text click the "Add" button and edit the newly created
  item
- To change the wording edit the "Expression" text box and press enter
  (or click the update button)
- Once you have selected a text item you can modify where it appears on
  the plot using layout
- You can also change it's font, size, bold/italic and color

<b>How Layout Works</b>

- Item layout is always relative to an object
- The orientation is where the text appears on that relative object
- The alignment is how the text rectangle itself is positioned
- Rotation is clockwise starting at the horizon

## Background

In James DAP4 xsd schema (last time I looked), the top level group was a
specific item in the top-level dataset element.

## Proposal

I propose that the top-level dataset be itself considered to be the
top-level group.

## Rationale

This proposal makes DAP4 consistent with netcdf-4, CDM, and HDF5.

I think we should accept this.

Generating the plot is as easy as clicking the blue plot button. The
plotter is designed so that in nearly all cases you will always get some
sort of plot when you press the plot button no matter what the data set
is (unless it is empty or has only a single value). There are some
important options, though, such as the output target. The area of the
screen with the controls for generating the plot is shown below:

- If you have data loaded and selection click the plot button and the
  plot will be drawn and sent to the output specified.

You can learn more about plotting by perusing the [plot
gallery](OPeNDAP_Data_Connector_Web_Guide#Check_out_the_ODC_Plot_Gallery "wikilink").

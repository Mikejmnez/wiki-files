OPeNDAP would like to welcome all the [Summer of
Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013) (SoC)
students for the 2013 iteration of the SoC program! On this page you'll
find information about project ideas we have along with information to
help you apply to work on our software. The projects range from web site
implementation to complex problems in data systems. Several of the
projects listed are focused on adding new features to our data server.
However, we also have a set of client tools and GUI-based applications
that would provide an ample basis for summer projects. If you don't see
anything below in the [\#Ideas](#Ideas "wikilink") section don't let
that stop you from starting a conversation with one of the mentors
listed below ([\#Mentors](#Mentors "wikilink")) because you may have an
idea, talent or skill that is the spark of a great project. Don't
hesitate to email us!

We would like to stress that while the ideas included here can be the
basis of your project, you can also propose something completely
different - maybe you've used our software and wish it included a
particular feature.

Before submitting an application to GSoC with OPeNDAP as your mentoring
organization, make sure you read our [GSoC
FAQ](Google_Summer_of_Code_FAQ "wikilink") as well as the
[Google](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page)
FAQ, both of which provide some pointers on how to write a successful
application.

## User Managment

1.  View user service access history and data requests. *I think this
    will require too much information be retained about users and their
    past actions. You could implement this with log analysis, but given
    that the logs' content can be changed and the logs are logs and thus
    likely not complete (truncated, rotated, etc.) I think it's just too
    much to bite off now. [User:jimg](User:jimg "wikilink")*

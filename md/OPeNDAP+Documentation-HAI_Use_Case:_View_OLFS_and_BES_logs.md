## Description

Provides Hyrax (OLFS and BES) log file access to Administrators.

## Goal

By providing Hyrax log file access we enable the Admin to assess issues
happening with a Hyrax instance. Once the log files have been viewed the
Admin may choose to take additional actions via the HAI.

## Summary

Once logged into the HAI the Admin selects a log to view. The HAI then
shows the Admin the log file.

## Actors

- Administrator
- HAI
- Hyrax (OLFS & BES(s))

## Preconditions

- The Administrator has an authentication privileges for an HAI.

## Triggers

For some reason the Admin wants to view the logs files generated by
Hyrax.

## Basic Flow

1.  [The Admin logs into the
    HAI](HAI_Use_Case:_Administrator_Logs_into_the_Hyrax_Admin_Interface "wikilink")
2.  The Admin uses the HAI to choose to view logs files.
3.  The Admin uses the HAI to select which log file(s) to view.
4.  The HAI returns a page (or portion thereof) that contains scrollable
    views of the logs file(s).

## Overview

Here are some simple guidelines for prioritizing bugs on a scale of 1 to
5, where 1 is the lowest priority and 5 is the highest:

*item* - a software feature or behavior

5 Highest
The ticket is about a priority item, The item is broken and there’s no
work around

4 High
The item is not a 'priority', it’s broken and there’s no work around

OR, The item is a priority, it's broken, but a work around exists.

3 Medium
The item is not a priority, it's broken, and a work around exists

2 Low
Priority feature is missing - something was left out of a
design/implementation that is a priority for us

1 Lowest:
A non-priority feature is missing

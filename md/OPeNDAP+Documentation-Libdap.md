### [libdap++ Reference Guide](https://opendap.github.io/libdap4/html/)

This reference guide is built from the source code using the *doxygen*
tool. Because the content is right next to the code it documents, it's
likely to be very accurate. In addition, doxygen builds various UML
diagrams that are always up to date.

### [OPeNDAP Programmer Guide](ProgrammerGuide "wikilink")

This programmer's Guide is fairly old but it holds much that's still
useful content.

Our web (www.opendap.org) page is the cumulative result of many people's
work over nearly fifteen years. It shows! Pages are out of date, some
important things are documented in several places (often with slight
differences) and the overall organization is very organic being spread
over three different actual sites. We need for a person with an interest
in web site design to work with us to transform the current collection
of pages into an informative web site. At the same time, the resulting
site must be one that we can maintain moving forward so that adding new
documentation about new software packages, making new software releases
available and updating existing documentation are all painless.

Candidate technologies are Drupal, MediaWiki, ...

Technical details of our current site(s):

- www.opendap.org uses CSS, HTML and server-side includes. Static pages
  are served using Apache; he pages are stored in our subversion
  repository so anyone can edit them, but someone must login to the
  server host to actually update the pages.
- <http://docs.opendap.org> is a mediawiki site where we are slowly
  migrating our documentation.
- <https://scm.opendap.org> is a TRAC site that has some developer
  documentation

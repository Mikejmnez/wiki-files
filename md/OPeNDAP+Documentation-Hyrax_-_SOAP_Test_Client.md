A prototype SOAP interface is included with this release of Hyrax.

The details of the SOAP interface are discussed in the [RSG template
pages
here](http://rsg.opendap.org:8090/server-4/templates/soapAPI.html).

Example client code can be found at our [web
site](http://www.opendap.org/download/hyrax.html), and can be found in
our [Subversion archive
here](http://scm.opendap.org:8090/trac/browser/tags/SoapTestClient).

@TODO: **Flesh out the usage and details of the SOAP Test Client**

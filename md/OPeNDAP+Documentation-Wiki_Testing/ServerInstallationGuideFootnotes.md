- <cite id=ref2> The actual directory name, or whether the CGI programs
  are kept in a particular directory (or named with a particular
  convention) is another detail of the specific web server and
  configuration used. The web server might refer to the directory as the
  ScriptAlias directory, as it does with Apache. </cite>
- <cite id=ref3> When you fill out some HTML form, you are usually
  sending data in a "POST" request. When you type a URL into your web
  browser, this is a "GET" request. HTTP servers can respond to both
  kinds of request.</cite>
- <cite id=ref4> This is not shown in this illustration, but it would
  follow a question mark in the URL, like this:
  <http://test.opendap.org/opendap/nph-dods/temp.nc.asc?temp%5B0:180>\]\[0:45\].

- <cite id=ref6>The user is yet another configurable feature. For the
  Apache server, you can look for a line in the configuration file
  specifying the user, using the keyword User. On my machine, where
  httpd runs as nobody, it looks like this: User nobody. </cite>

  thorny configuration details for securing the Apache/DODS/OPeNDAP
  combination. </cite>

  server from source code and specified a different root directory for
  its installation. </cite>

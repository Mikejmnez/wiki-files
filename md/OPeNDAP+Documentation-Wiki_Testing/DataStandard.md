# Preface

This document describes the various data standards that may be used by
the \DODS (DODS) data providers to facilitate the interoperability of
DODS datasets. These standards are not essential to the operation of the
DODS software, but are only meant as a guide to those providers for whom
interoperability is an important consideration.

This document is relevant to version \DODSversion and later of DODS.

## Who is this Guide for?

This guide is designed to address the concerns of scientists and others
who wish to use DODS to make their data available to one, two, or
zillions of other scientists (and other others). Making data available
using DODS is usually only half of the battle. It is often the case that
for data to be actually useful to others, it must conform to certain
data standards expected by other users or other users' software. This
manual documents standards used and *recommended* (not required) by the
DODS group.

This guide assumes a basic familiarity with the DODS software package.
Refer to the \DODSuser for an overview of the package.

## WCS data access via DAP2 requests

We have implemented two approaches to providing this access.

### 1. THREDDS DispatchHandler

Using this handler the olfs can read and serve very large THREDDS
catalogs.

Mechanism: Reads and parses all local catalogs. Can cache:

- Only the file name (minimum memory footprint)
- raw (unparsed) bytes from catalog files resident in memory. (medium
  memory footprint)
- All catalog files parsed into memory resident JDOM Documents. (large
  memory footprint)

Responses are generated by either returning the THREDDS catalog as the
source XML, or by transforming the catalog into an HTML document to be
rendered in a a browser and viewed by humans.

WCS data can be served by carefully constructing the THREDDS service
definitions and the dataset elements urlPath attributes to point to the
wcs_service (described below).

This handler relies on XSLT to generate the human readable HTML for the
catalog pages. The XSL code does not yet support the full THEDDS schema.

### 2. wcs_service

This handler provides DAP access to WCS servers. The WCS request URL is
converted to a hex/ASCII representation and used as the data set name.
For example, this WCS request:

[`http://geobrain.laits.gmu.edu/cgi-bin/ACCESS/wcs627?service=WCS&version=1.0.0&request=GetCoverage&coverage=/Volumes/RAIDL2/GeoData/CEOP/MYD05/LIN/MYD05_L2.A2002274.1240.005.2007073060134.hdf:Swath:mod05:Water_Vapor_Infrared&crs=WGS84&bbox=11.745000,49.825000,16.495000,54.575000&format=netCDF&TIME=2002-10-01&resx=0.25&resy=0.25&interpolationMethod=Nearest%20neighbor`](http://geobrain.laits.gmu.edu/cgi-bin/ACCESS/wcs627?service=WCS&version=1.0.0&request=GetCoverage&coverage=/Volumes/RAIDL2/GeoData/CEOP/MYD05/LIN/MYD05_L2.A2002274.1240.005.2007073060134.hdf:Swath:mod05:Water_Vapor_Infrared&crs=WGS84&bbox=11.745000,49.825000,16.495000,54.575000&format=netCDF&TIME=2002-10-01&resx=0.25&resy=0.25&interpolationMethod=Nearest%20neighbor)

Gets encoded like this:

And used as a dataset name. Thus, this URL:

Will get you the DDS for the dataset returned by the example WCS
request.

Although the URL is "opaque" it is transparent within the THREDDS
catalog. The urlPath attribute of the dataset element contains only the
encoded WCS request URL. Additional properties (metadata) can be added
to the THREDDS catalog, but will not show up in a DAS or DDX response
from the service (cause that starts looking like AIS).

### 3. WCS DispatchHandler for the OLFS.

This was an attempt to build a generic client for a WCS service. The
result was one that works for the CEOP AIRS WCS service
(http://g0dup05u.ecs.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/ceopAIRX2RET) but in no way
represents a generalized solution. It is explained fully here: [WCS
Handler](WCS_Handler "wikilink") \[ We evaluated a number of other WCS
servers and discovered a surprisingly broad range of interpretations of
the specification.

I think the major obstacles are:

- **Coordinate systems**: My reading of the WCS specification made me
  think that the idea was for the servers to be doing re-projection work
  for the clients. This turns out to be not the common case. Some
  servers can re-project, others can re-project for some
  CoverageOfferings, and others not at all. Additionally, coordinate
  system conversion would we required to map "SIte" definitions to the
  various CoverageOfferings. This means that a generalized client for
  WCS must carry the software to do the re-projection work. Having the
  DAP server handle reprojection and coordinate conversion is (IMHO):
  - Beyond the scope of this task
  - Fraught with difficulty

<!-- -->

- **Scaleability**: The WCS specification demands that each
  CoverageOffering be described by one (or both) of it's spatial or
  temporal extents. Problems arise when WCS servers hold satellite
  imagery which is bound by both space and time and then don't actually
  use temporal domain information in their CovergeOffering elements.
  They may have a time that represents when the data was acquired, but
  not a range. Essentially pushing the the job of finding coverage data
  for a specific time to the client. The result is that the WCS service
  returns a fairly large (\>100MB) XML document in response to
  GetCapabilities request. This is unwieldy for the client and creates
  peformance issues. Holding the parsed documents in memory is a problem
  causes excessive (i.e. un-scaleable) memory use. Caching the documents
  on local disk and doesn't really help much as it:
  - Requires the same memory usage: To get any piece of of the cached
    document it you have to parse the whole thing anyway.
  - Could use MORE memory if multiple connections require the large
    document to parsed simultaneously
  - And disk caching will greatly slow performance - reading and parsing
    the document for each request will be slow and could lead to disk
    thrashing.

It is my thinking at this time that we could potentially build a point
and click map interface (similar to that used by LAS) for this. Pushing
the acquisition and caching of the GetCapabilities document onto the
client (browser?). It would be navigated by the user to build the WCS
request URL which could then be encoded and sent to the wcs_service
described above.

**THREDDS catalogs do not work for this handler at this time.**

### NEEDS

**thredds handler:**

- Mechanism for reloading the THREDDS catalogs - (Check !RootCatalogs?
  Check every catalog?, Trigger?)
- Extend the thredds.xsl file to fully support the THREDDS schema.
  - Compound services.
  - Inherited metadata.
  - Work w/Ethan and John.
- Add config parameter to allow storing the parsed XML document.
- Examine the XSL for catalogRef and make sure the xlink:href works
  correctly.
- Inspect and repair the way that catalogRef elements are evaluated
  during the servlet init(). Only look at local files (don't go off
  site)
- Look at what happens if absolute path names are used in naming catalog
  files (in the config's threddsCatalogRoot elements) or in the
  xlink:href of a catalogRef

**wcs_service:**

- Trusted Hosts list for wcs_service !DispatchHandler.

**wcs_handler:**

- Are there THREDDS catalogs for the WCS !DispatchHandler? No? Fix it...

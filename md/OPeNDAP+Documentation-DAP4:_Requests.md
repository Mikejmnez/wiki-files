Note that while it's increasingly common for DAP servers to provide
different ways that a dataset's metadata may be extended, and often
those provide multiple ways of accessing the same underlying data,
albeit with different metadata. Those extensions are all accessed by
dereferencing a URL and we consider each URL to refer to a unique
dataset. This can be confusing because the word 'dataset' is often
synonymous with 'file' although there's nothing in DAP2 or DAP4 that
makes that association required or calls it out as a case with special
treatment

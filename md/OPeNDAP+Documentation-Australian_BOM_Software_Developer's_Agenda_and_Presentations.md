## Software Developer's Workshop

Wednesday 17 October to Thursday 18 October

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This workshop will target developers and focus on building custom
modules, adding support for new data formats and new service protocols
to, as well as extending the server to support server-side functions and
other protocols. Developers will learn how to enable client applications
to access OPeNDAP data servers using several different client libraries.

All attendees are asked to bring a PC laptop and will be given a Linux
virtual machine. If people want to use a Mac, they will have to be able
to 'roll with the punches' when it comes to building code in that
environment.

We will provide attendees with a binder for the lecture and hands-on
info.

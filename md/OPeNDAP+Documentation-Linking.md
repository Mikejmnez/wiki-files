# Linking

Programs using libdap++ will require libcurl and libmxml2. You can find
links to these at [the third party
page](http://opendap.org/download/thirdPartySource.html).

There are no special instructions for linking the libdap code to your
own. The library that results from a build of the libdap code is called
libdap++.
